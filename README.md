# **Monitoring a Containerized URL Shortener Webservice**

---

## **Project Idea**

Our project is to build and monitor a containerized URL shortener webservice.  
The application allows users to shorten long URLs and handle redirects.  
We will containerize the service using **Docker**, store data with **SQLite**, and expose **custom performance metrics**.  

**Prometheus** will collect these metrics, and **Grafana** will be used to create dashboards and alerts for monitoring.  
By the end, we aim to deliver a fully functional, persistent, and monitored webservice with complete documentation.

## **Work Plan**

### **1. Research & Analysis**
- Study existing URL shortener services and monitoring tools.  
- Research Docker containerization, Prometheus metrics, and Grafana dashboards.

### **2. Audience Personas**
- Developers who need an easy-to-deploy, self-hosted URL shortener.  
- Teams or companies seeking performance insights through metrics and monitoring.

### **3. Visual Identity**
- Design a simple and professional brand for the web interface and dashboards.

### **4. Logo Design**
- Create a minimal logo representing links, monitoring, or performance.

### **5. Main Designs**
- Build the main UI for URL input and results.  
- Implement responsive design for usability on multiple devices.

### **6. Poster**
- Design a poster summarizing the project’s goals, architecture, and tools.

### **7. Complementary Products**
- Write documentation for setup and usage.  
- Include API documentation and dashboard configuration steps.

### **8. Review & Finalization**
- Perform code review and container testing.  
- Optimize metrics collection and alert configurations.

### **9. Final Presentation**
- Demonstrate the full system, showing metrics collection and dashboards live.
